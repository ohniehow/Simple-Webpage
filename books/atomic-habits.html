            <h2>Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones</h2>
                <p>An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.</p>
                <p>Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.</p>
                <p>Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.</p>
